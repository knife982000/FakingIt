### Requirements

Currently, the tool only supports Twitter as social meddia. Hence for retrieving the data, the tool will require configuring the corresponding Twitter API keys. API keys can be obtained from the [Twitter Developers portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens.html).

### Configuration

As the proposed dataset will include information from multiple sources, the tool will provide options to retrieve specific subsets of data, such as news content, news images, related images, related news, social media context, related usersâ€™ metadata, social networks, amongst others, based on the specific input given to the tool.
